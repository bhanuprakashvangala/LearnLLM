## AI for Images: Generate Professional Visuals

<Callout type="info">
**Image Generation (Text-to-Image):** AI models that create images from text descriptions. These systems are trained on millions of image-text pairs and can generate photorealistic images, artwork, or designs based on your written prompts.
</Callout>

### The Big Three Image Generators

#### 1. DALL-E 3 (OpenAI)

**Access:** ChatGPT Plus ($20/month)

**Best For:**
- Quick, integrated workflow (text + images in same chat)
- Photorealistic images
- Text in images (best at this)
- Following complex prompts accurately

<Callout type="info">
**Prompt Engineering (for Images):** The practice of crafting effective text descriptions to generate desired images. Good image prompts specify subject, style, composition, lighting, mood, and technical details to guide the AI's generation process.
</Callout>

**Prompt Example:**
```
Create a professional blog header image:

Style: Minimalist, modern, tech-focused
Subject: A person working productively with AI tools
Mood: Inspiring, clean, bright
Colors: Blue and white palette
Composition: Horizontal 16:9 ratio
Details: Laptop, clean desk, natural light from window
Text: None (will add separately)

Photorealistic, high quality, suitable for blog header.
```

#### 2. Midjourney

**Access:** Discord bot, $10-60/month

**Best For:**
- Artistic, stylized images
- Creative/abstract concepts
- Highest aesthetic quality
- Specific art styles

**Prompt Example:**
```
/imagine prompt: minimalist workspace with laptop and coffee,
clean desk, natural window light, soft shadows, professional
photography, depth of field, warm tones, peaceful atmosphere,
--ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6
```

**Midjourney Parameters:**
- `--ar 16:9` = Aspect ratio
- `--style raw` = More photographic
- `--v 6` = Version 6 (latest)
- `--stylize 100` = How artistic (0-1000)

#### 3. Stable Diffusion

**Access:** Free (self-hosted), various paid services

**Best For:**
- Complete control
- Free unlimited generation (if self-hosted)
- Customization and fine-tuning
- Privacy (local generation)

**Complexity:** More technical, but most powerful

    },
    {
      feature: "Speed",
      values: ["Fast", "Medium", "Varies"]
    }
  ]}
/>

### Image Prompting Best Practices

**Anatomy of a Good Image Prompt:**

```
[SUBJECT] + [STYLE] + [COMPOSITION] + [LIGHTING] + [MOOD] + [TECHNICAL]

Example:
"A modern minimalist home office [SUBJECT]
in Scandinavian design style [STYLE],
wide angle view from the doorway [COMPOSITION],
soft natural light from large window [LIGHTING],
calm and inspiring atmosphere [MOOD],
architectural photography, high detail, 8K [TECHNICAL]"
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Too vague: "a nice office"
- ❌ Conflicting elements: "dark and bright"
- ❌ Too many subjects: Listing 10 different objects
- ✅ Specific and focused: Clear subject, clear style, clear mood

<Quiz
  title="AI Content Creation Mastery"
  questions={[
    {
      question: "What's the most efficient way to create a blog post with AI?",
      options: [
        "Ask AI to write the entire post in one prompt",
        "Use a workflow: idea → outline → section-by-section → refine → SEO",
        "Copy-paste AI output directly without editing",
        "Write it yourself, AI can't help with writing"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Break it down! The workflow approach (idea → outline → draft sections → refine → SEO) produces much better results than 'write me a blog post.' Each step builds on the previous, giving you control and quality. One-shot prompts produce generic content."
    },
    {
      question: "For blog header images, which tool is best for most people?",
      options: [
        "Hire a designer ($50-200)",
        "DALL-E 3 via ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo, easy integration)",
        "Midjourney (requires Discord, learning curve)",
        "Stable Diffusion (requires technical setup)"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "For most people, DALL-E 3 via ChatGPT Plus wins! You're already there writing the post, just ask for images. Midjourney has better aesthetics but requires Discord and more learning. Stable Diffusion is powerful but technical. DALL-E is the easiest integrated workflow."
    },
    {
      question: "What's a realistic expectation for AI video generation (as of 2024)?",
      options: [
        "Create full 10-minute professional videos easily",
        "Generate short clips (5-15 sec), B-roll, or use AI avatars for presentations",
        "Replace all video editing and production",
        "AI video doesn't work yet"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Be realistic! AI video (Runway, Pika) is great for short clips, B-roll, concept visualization, and AI avatars (Synthesia/HeyGen) work well for presentations. But it's not ready for long narrative videos or complex scenes. Use it for what it's good at—supplement, not replace, traditional video."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best practice for image prompts?",
      options: [
        "Keep it super short: 'a dog'",
        "List every tiny detail: 50+ descriptors",
        "Use structure: Subject + Style + Composition + Lighting + Mood + Technical details",
        "Just describe the subject"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Structure wins! Good image prompts have: Subject (what), Style (how it looks), Composition (framing), Lighting (light setup), Mood (feeling), Technical (quality, ratio). This gives AI clear direction. Too vague = generic results. Too detailed = confusion. Structured = consistent quality!"
    },
    {
      question: "How should you handle AI-generated content for commercial use?",
      options: [
        "Always safe to use, it's your content",
        "Never use commercially, always risky",
        "Check each tool's licensing, save documentation, review terms of service",
        "Only use if you don't tell anyone it's AI-generated"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Do your homework! Most AI tools (ChatGPT, DALL-E, Claude) grant commercial rights to outputs, but: (1) check each tool's terms, (2) save documentation that you created it, (3) some platforms (stock sites) may not accept AI content, (4) copyright law is still evolving. Be informed and compliant!"
