## What Are Tokens?

When you type a message to ChatGPT, it doesn't read it the same way you do. It breaks your text into small pieces called **tokens**.

<Callout type="info">
**Token Definition:** The basic unit of text that AI models process. A token can be a word, part of a word, or even a punctuation mark. AI models don't read text character-by-character like humans—they break it into tokens first, then process those tokens to understand and generate language.
</Callout>

### Tokens Are Like Puzzle Pieces

Think of tokens as puzzle pieces:
- A token can be a whole word: "cat" = 1 token
- Or part of a word: "running" = "run" + "ning" = 2 tokens
- Or a punctuation mark: "!" = 1 token
- Even spaces count!

<Callout type="info">
**Rule of Thumb:**
- 1 token ≈ 4 characters in English
- 100 tokens ≈ 75 words
- 1,000 tokens ≈ 750 words (about 1 page)

So a typical ChatGPT response of 200 words is about 265 tokens!
</Callout>

### Why Do Tokens Matter?

1. **Cost**: AI companies charge per token
   - Input tokens (what you send)
   - Output tokens (what the AI generates)

2. **Limits**: There's a maximum number of tokens the AI can handle at once

3. **Understanding**: How text is tokenized affects how the AI understands it

## Let's See Tokens in Action

Here's a simple interactive example showing how text becomes tokens:

<CodePlayground
  language="javascript"
  runnable={true}
  initialCode={`// Simple tokenization example (real tokenization is more complex)

function simpleTokenize(text) {
  // Split on spaces and punctuation
  const tokens = text
    .toLowerCase()
    .split(/([\\s,.!?;:()-]+)/)
    .filter(t => t.trim().length > 0);

  return tokens;
}

// Try different texts
const examples = [
  "Hello, world!",
  "I love AI",
  "The cat sat on the mat.",
  "GPT-4 is amazing!"
];

examples.forEach(text => {
  const tokens = simpleTokenize(text);
  console.log(\`Text: "\${text}"\`);
  console.log(\`Tokens: [\${tokens.map(t => '"' + t + '"').join(', ')}]\`);
  console.log(\`Count: \${tokens.length} tokens\\n\`);
});

// Real-world example: a longer text
const longText = "Artificial intelligence is transforming how we work, learn, and create. Large language models like GPT can understand and generate human-like text!";
const longTokens = simpleTokenize(longText);
console.log("=== Longer Example ===");
console.log(\`Text length: \${longText.length} characters\`);
console.log(\`Approximate tokens: \${longTokens.length}\`);
console.log(\`Ratio: ~\${(longText.length / longTokens.length).toFixed(1)} characters per token\`);`}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
**Note:** This is a simplified example! Real tokenization (like GPT's BPE tokenization) is more sophisticated and considers subword patterns, common phrases, and statistical frequency. But the concept is the same: breaking text into pieces.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Tokenization Definition:** The process of breaking text into smaller pieces (tokens) that an AI model can understand. Different models use different tokenization methods, but all convert human-readable text into tokens before processing, similar to how you might break a sentence into individual words or syllables.
</Callout>

## What is a Context Window?

The **context window** is the maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that an AI model can "see" and "remember" at one time.

<Callout type="info">
**Context Window Definition:** The maximum number of tokens an AI model can process at once, including your conversation history, prompts, and responses. Think of it as the AI's "working memory"—everything within this window is visible to the model, but anything outside it is forgotten.
</Callout>

Think of it like short-term memory:
- You can remember the last few things someone said in a conversation
- But you can't remember every word from a 3-hour conversation
- AI is similar - it has a "memory limit"

### Context Window Sizes

Different models have different context windows:

<ComparisonTable

  columns={[
    { title: "Context Window" },
    { title: "Approximate Pages" }
  ]}
  rows={[
    {
      feature: "GPT-3.5",
      values: ["4,096 tokens", "~3 pages"]
    },
    {
      feature: "GPT-3.5-16k",
      values: ["16,384 tokens", "~12 pages"]
    },
    {
      feature: "GPT-4",
      values: ["8,192 tokens", "~6 pages"],

    },
    {

      values: ["32,768 tokens", "~24 pages"]
    },
    {
      feature: "GPT-4 Turbo",
      values: ["128,000 tokens", "~96 pages"]
    },
    {
      feature: "Claude 2",
      values: ["100,000 tokens", "~75 pages"]
    },
    {
      feature: "Claude 3",
      values: ["200,000 tokens", "~150 pages"]
    },
    {
      feature: "Gemini 1.5 Pro",
      values: ["1,000,000 tokens", "~750 pages"]
    }
  ]}
/>

### What Counts Toward the Context Window?

Everything! The context window includes:
- ✅ Your entire conversation history
- ✅ System instructions (hidden prompts)
- ✅ Your current prompt
- ✅ The AI's responses
- ✅ Any documents you upload (if supported)

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro Tip:** If you have a very long conversation with ChatGPT, it might start "forgetting" things you said at the beginning. That's because older messages get pushed out of the context window!
</Callout>

## How Context Window Affects You

### Scenario 1: Long Documents

**Question:** "Can I upload a 200-page PDF to ChatGPT?"

**Answer:** Depends on the model!
- GPT-4 (8k): ❌ Won't fit
- GPT-4 Turbo: ✅ Might fit
- Gemini 1.5 Pro: ✅ Easily fits

### Scenario 2: Long Conversations

Imagine you're having a coding help session:
- Message 1-10: Discussing project requirements (1,500 tokens)
- Message 11-20: Writing code together (2,500 tokens)
- Message 21-30: Debugging (2,000 tokens)
- **Total: 6,000 tokens**

With a 4k context model, the AI would start "forgetting" your early requirements!

### Scenario 3: Summarizing Content

Want to summarize a long article?
- Article: 5,000 tokens
- Your prompt: 100 tokens
- AI response: 300 tokens
- **Total needed: 5,400 tokens**

You need a model with at least a 8k context window!

## Interactive Token Calculator

<CodePlayground
  language="javascript"
  runnable={true}
  title="Context Window Calculator"
  initialCode={`// Estimate if your content fits in different models

function estimateTokens(text) {
  // Simple estimation: ~4 characters per token in English
  return Math.ceil(text.length / 4);
}

function checkFitsInContext(tokens, modelName, contextSize) {
  const fits = tokens <= contextSize;
  const percentage = ((tokens / contextSize) * 100).toFixed(1);

  console.log(\`\${modelName} (\${contextSize.toLocaleString()} tokens):\`);
  console.log(\`  \${fits ? '✓' : '✗'} \${fits ? 'FITS' : 'TOO LARGE'}\`);
  console.log(\`  Using \${percentage}% of context\`);
  console.log();
}

// Example: Your content
const myContent = \`
This is my article about artificial intelligence.
It discusses how AI is transforming industries.
Large language models can understand context.
They use transformers and attention mechanisms.
The future of AI is bright and full of possibilities.
\`.trim();

const estimatedTokens = estimateTokens(myContent);

console.log("YOUR CONTENT");
console.log("=".repeat(40));
console.log(\`Characters: \${myContent.length}\`);
console.log(\`Estimated tokens: ~\${estimatedTokens}\`);
console.log();

console.log("MODEL COMPATIBILITY");
console.log("=".repeat(40));

// Check against different models
const models = [
  { name: "GPT-3.5", context: 4096 },
  { name: "GPT-4", context: 8192 },
  { name: "GPT-4 Turbo", context: 128000 },
  { name: "Claude 3", context: 200000 }
];

models.forEach(model => {
  checkFitsInContext(estimatedTokens, model.name, model.context);
});

// Example: Larger content
console.log("\\nLARGE DOCUMENT EXAMPLE");
console.log("=".repeat(40));
const largeDoc = 50000; // 50k characters ≈ 12.5k tokens
const largeTokens = estimateTokens("x".repeat(largeDoc));
console.log(\`Document: \${largeDoc.toLocaleString()} characters\`);
console.log(\`Estimated: ~\${largeTokens.toLocaleString()} tokens\\n\`);

models.forEach(model => {
  checkFitsInContext(largeTokens, model.name, model.context);
});`}
/>

## Why Context Windows Have Limits

You might wonder: "Why not make the context window infinite?"

### Technical Reasons:

1. **Computational Cost**: Longer context = exponentially more computation
   - Processing scales quadratically (O(n²))
   - 2x context = 4x computation
   - 10x context = 100x computation!

2. **Memory Requirements**: Keeping all that context in memory is expensive

3. **Quality Degradation**: Models can "lose track" in very long contexts

<Callout type="info">
**The Math:** If processing 1,000 tokens takes 1 second, processing 10,000 tokens might take 100 seconds (not 10), because attention mechanisms look at every token pair!
</Callout>

## Practical Tips

### 1. Start Fresh for New Topics
If switching topics, start a new conversation to avoid wasting context on irrelevant history.

### 2. Summarize Long Conversations
Ask the AI to summarize key points, then start fresh with the summary.

### 3. Choose the Right Model
- Short queries: Smaller context is fine (and cheaper!)
- Long documents: Use models with larger context windows
- Long conversations: Consider GPT-4 Turbo or Claude 3

### 4. Be Concise
More tokens = more cost and less room for other content.

        "Everything: conversation history, prompts, and responses",
        "Just the system instructions"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The context window includes EVERYTHING: your entire conversation history, all AI responses, system instructions, and your current prompt. It all adds up!"
    },
    {
      question: "Why can't AI models have infinite context windows?",

        "Companies want to charge more money",
        "Computation scales quadratically - 2x context = 4x computation",
        "The internet isn't fast enough",
        "Humans wouldn't understand it"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Context window size is limited by computation costs. Processing scales quadratically (O(n²)), meaning doubling the context requires 4x the computation. This makes very long contexts extremely expensive and slow."
    },
    {
      question: "If a model has a 4,096 token context and you've used 3,500 tokens in conversation history, how many tokens do you have left?",

        "1,000 tokens",
        "4,096 tokens (it resets)",
        "Unlimited"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "4,096 - 3,500 = 596 tokens remaining. This includes room for both your next prompt AND the AI's response. If you try to send a 1,000-token prompt, it won't fit!"

## Key Takeaways

🔑 **Tokens** = Small pieces of text (≈4 characters each)
- Models process text as tokens, not characters
- Everything you send/receive counts as tokens
- Tokens determine cost and limits

🔑 **Context Window** = Maximum tokens the model can handle
- Includes ALL conversation history
- Different models have different limits (4k to 1M tokens)
- Bigger context = more capability but higher cost

🔑 **Practical Impact**:
- Long conversations may cause the AI to "forget" early messages
- Choose models based on your context needs
- Start fresh conversations for new topics
