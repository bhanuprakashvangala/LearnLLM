## Welcome to Your First Real Practice!

You've learned about LLMs, training, tokens, and prompt engineering. Now it's time to put it all together with hands-on practice!

<Callout type="info">
**What You'll Do:** In this lesson, you'll see real examples, bad vs. good prompts, and get exercises to try yourself. You can use ChatGPT (free version), Claude, Gemini, or any LLM you have access to!
</Callout>

## Exercise 1: The Content Creator

### Scenario
You're starting a blog about healthy eating and need help creating content.

### ❌ First Attempt (Beginner)
```
Write a blog post about healthy eating
```

**What happens:**
- Generic, unfocused content
- No specific audience
- Random structure
- Could be for anyone, about anything

### ✅ Improved Version (Apply What You Learned)
```
You are a nutritionist writing for busy professionals who want
to eat healthier but have limited time.

Write a 300-word blog post titled "5-Minute Healthy Breakfasts
for Busy Mornings" that includes:

1. A brief intro explaining why breakfast matters (2 sentences)
2. Three quick breakfast ideas with ingredients
3. One time-saving tip
4. A motivating conclusion

Tone: Encouraging and practical, not preachy
Avoid: Complicated recipes, expensive ingredients, nutritionist jargon
```

**Why it's better:**
- ✅ Clear role (nutritionist)
- ✅ Specific audience (busy professionals)
- ✅ Exact structure (numbered list)
- ✅ Tone specified (encouraging)
- ✅ Exclusions listed (what NOT to do)

<Callout type="tip">
**Try This Yourself!** Copy the improved prompt into ChatGPT or your preferred LLM. Notice how focused and useful the output is compared to the vague version. Then try modifying it for a different audience (e.g., "college students on a budget")!
</Callout>

## Exercise 2: The Code Helper

### Scenario
You're learning Python and stuck on a concept.

### ❌ Common Mistake
```
explain loops
```

**Problems:**
- Which programming language?
- What's your current skill level?
- What specifically is confusing?
- How do you learn best?

### ✅ Better Approach
```
I'm learning Python and confused about for loops vs while loops.

I understand basic concepts like variables and if statements,
but I don't know when to use each type of loop.

Can you:
1. Explain the difference in simple terms
2. Give me a real-world analogy for each
3. Show two short code examples (one for each type)
4. Tell me when to use which

Explain like I'm a beginner, but don't oversimplify - I want
to truly understand the concept.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies language and topic
- States current knowledge level
- Clear, numbered requests
- Examples requested
- Learning style specified

Let's simulate this with code:

<CodePlayground
  language="python"
  title="For Loop vs While Loop - Examples"
  runnable={false}
  initialCode={`# FOR LOOP: When you know how many times to repeat
# Like: "Do this 5 times"

print("FOR LOOP EXAMPLE - Counting to 5:")
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Count: {i}")

print("\\n" + "="*40 + "\\n")

# WHILE LOOP: When you repeat until a condition is met
# Like: "Keep doing this until X happens"

print("WHILE LOOP EXAMPLE - Count until we hit 5:")
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1

print("\\n" + "="*40 + "\\n")

# REAL DIFFERENCE:
# FOR: "Process each item in this list"
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("FOR: Processing a list of fruits:")
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"  - {fruit}")

print()

# WHILE: "Keep asking until they say yes"
print("WHILE: Simulating user input (demonstration):")
answer = "no"
attempts = 0
while answer != "yes" and attempts < 3:
    attempts += 1
    print(f"  Attempt {attempts}: Answer is '{answer}'")
    # In real code, you'd get input from user
    if attempts == 3:
        answer = "yes"  # Simulate them saying yes

print(f"  Finally got 'yes' after {attempts} attempts!")

# RULE OF THUMB:
# - FOR: When you have a collection or know the count
# - WHILE: When you're waiting for a condition`}
/>

<Callout type="info">
**Key Learning:** Notice how providing context about your skill level helps the AI pitch its response appropriately. "I'm a beginner" gets different examples than "I'm experienced but confused about..."
</Callout>

## Exercise 3: The Problem Solver

### Scenario
Your laptop is running slow and you need troubleshooting help.

### ❌ Too Vague
```
my computer is slow
```

### ⚠️ Better But Still Not Great
```
my computer is slow, how do I fix it?
```

### ✅ Excellent Problem Description
```
My laptop is running significantly slower than usual.

Details:
- Windows 11, Dell XPS 15, 16GB RAM
- Started 3 days ago after Windows update
- Slowest when opening Chrome or switching between apps
- Hard drive shows 80% full
- No obvious malware (ran Windows Defender)

I'm comfortable with basic troubleshooting (restarting, updating
drivers) but not advanced technical fixes.

Can you suggest 3-5 most likely causes and step-by-step fixes,
ordered from easiest to hardest?

For each fix, let me know:
- How long it takes
- Risk level (can I break anything?)
- Whether it requires technical expertise
```

**Why this is powerful:**
- Specific symptoms
- Context (when it started, what changed)
- What you've already tried
- Your comfort level with solutions
- Exactly what format you want

<ComparisonTable
  title="Vague vs Detailed Problem Descriptions"
  columns={[
    { title: "Aspect" },
    { title: "Vague" },
    { title: "Detailed" }
  ]}
  rows={[
    {
      feature: "Problem Statement",
      values: ["Computer slow", "Slow when opening Chrome/switching apps"]
    },
    {
      feature: "Context",
      values: ["None provided", "Started after Windows update 3 days ago"]
    },
    {
      feature: "System Info",
      values: ["None", "Windows 11, Dell XPS 15, 16GB RAM, 80% disk full"]
    },
    {
      feature: "What You Tried",
      values: ["Nothing mentioned", "Ran Windows Defender, no malware found"]
    },
    {
      feature: "Your Skill Level",
      values: ["Unknown", "Comfortable with basic, not advanced fixes"]
    },
    {
      feature: "Desired Response",
      values: ["Generic advice", "3-5 causes, step-by-step fixes, ordered by difficulty"]
    }
  ]}
/>

## Exercise 4: The Creative Writer

### Scenario
You need help writing a birthday message for your boss.

### ❌ Lazy Attempt
```
write a birthday message for my boss
```

### ✅ Context-Rich Request
```
Help me write a professional birthday message for my boss's
card that the whole team is signing.

Context:
- She's been with the company 10 years
- Known for being supportive and mentoring team members
- Recently helped our team through a challenging project
- The team culture is professional but warm (not stiff/formal)

Tone: Appreciative and warm, but professional
Length: 2-3 sentences (it's going in a card)
Avoid: Generic platitudes, overly casual language, anything
that could be seen as brown-nosing

I want it to feel genuine and specific to her impact on the team.
```

**Better output because:**
- Relationship context provided
- Specific things to mention
- Tone carefully calibrated
- Length constraint realistic
- Clear "avoid" list prevents awkward AI suggestions

## Practical Patterns That Always Work

<Callout type="info">
**Prompt Patterns Definition:** Reusable templates or structures for prompts that consistently produce good results. Like design patterns in programming, prompt patterns give you proven frameworks to adapt for different situations rather than starting from scratch each time.
</Callout>

### Pattern 1: The "I need X for Y" Structure
```
I need [TYPE OF CONTENT] for [PURPOSE/AUDIENCE].

Context: [RELEVANT DETAILS]

Format: [HOW YOU WANT IT]

Constraints: [LENGTH/TONE/STYLE]
```

### Pattern 2: The "Help Me Understand" Structure
```
I'm trying to understand [CONCEPT].

What I know: [YOUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE]

What confuses me: [SPECIFIC CONFUSION]

Can you explain [WHAT YOU WANT] using [HOW TO EXPLAIN]?
```

### Pattern 3: The "Review My Work" Structure
```
I've [WHAT YOU DID] for [PURPOSE].

Here it is:
[YOUR WORK]

Please review it and provide:
1. [WHAT TO CHECK]
2. [WHAT TO IMPROVE]
3. [WHAT WORKS WELL]

Target audience: [WHO IT'S FOR]
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<ComparisonTable
  title="Common Prompting Pitfalls"
  columns={[
    { title: "Mistake" },
    { title: "Why It's Bad" },
    { title: "Fix" }
  ]}
  rows={[
    {
      feature: "Too vague",
      values: ["AI guesses at intent", "Add specific details and context"]
    },
    {
      feature: "Multiple unrelated questions",
      values: ["Unfocused, messy response", "One clear task per prompt"]
    },
    {
      feature: "No audience specified",
      values: ["Generic, wrong level", "State who it's for (kids, experts, etc.)"]
    },
    {
      feature: "Assuming AI knows context",
      values: ["Missing key information", "Always provide background"]
    },
    {
      feature: "No format/length guidance",
      values: ["Wrong structure or too long", "Specify: paragraphs, bullets, word count"]
    }
  ]}
/>

## Your Practice Exercises

Now it's your turn! Try these exercises with a real LLM:

### 🎯 Exercise A: The Explainer
**Task:** Get the AI to explain "how WiFi works" to three different audiences:
1. A 10-year-old
2. A high school student
3. A college engineering student

**Challenge:** Same topic, three different prompts. Notice how you adjust language and depth!

### 🎯 Exercise B: The Translator
**Task:** You need to write an email declining a meeting invitation politely.
- The meeting conflicts with another commitment
- You want to suggest an alternative time
- Keep it professional but warm

<Callout type="info">
**Iterative Prompting Definition:** The practice of refining and improving your prompts based on the AI's responses. If the first output isn't perfect, you add more details, constraints, or examples and try again. Good prompting is rarely perfect on the first try—it's a conversation and refinement process.
</Callout>

**Practice:** Write a detailed prompt that gets you a perfect email!

### 🎯 Exercise C: The Debugger
**Task:** You have this code that isn't working:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total + num
    return total / len(numbers)

print(calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
```

**Challenge:** Write a prompt that:
1. Explains what's wrong
2. Shows the fix
3. Explains WHY it wasn't working
4. Gives a tip to avoid this in the future

<Callout type="tip">
**Hint:** The more context you give about your skill level and what you want to learn, the better the explanation!
</Callout>

## Real vs Simulated AI Responses

Since we can't call a real LLM API in this lesson, let's simulate how different prompt qualities affect responses:

<CodePlayground
  language="javascript"
  runnable={true}
  title="Prompt Quality Response Simulator"
  initialCode={`// Simulate how prompt quality affects AI responses

function simulateResponse(prompt) {
  const quality = assessQuality(prompt);
  const responses = getResponses(quality);

  return {
    quality: quality,
    response: responses[quality]
  };
}

function assessQuality(prompt) {
  const hasContext = /context|background|about/i.test(prompt);
  const hasStructure = /\\d+\\.|first|then|finally/i.test(prompt);
  const hasConstraints = /words|sentences|paragraphs/i.test(prompt);
  const hasAudience = /for|to|audience/i.test(prompt);

  const score = [hasContext, hasStructure, hasConstraints, hasAudience]
    .filter(Boolean).length;

  if (score === 0) return 'poor';
  if (score <= 2) return 'okay';
  return 'good';
}

function getResponses(quality) {
  return {
    poor: \`Response: Here's some general information...
[Generic, unfocused, may not match your needs]
[Could be too technical OR too simple]
[Missing key details you wanted]\`,

    okay: \`Response: Based on your request, here's information about...
[More focused, but might miss some nuances]
[Generally helpful but not perfectly tailored]
[You might need to ask follow-up questions]\`,

    good: \`Response: I understand you need this for [specific purpose].
Here's a tailored response that:
1. [Addresses your exact needs]
2. [Matches your audience/context]
3. [Follows your specified format]

[Detailed, specific, actionable content]
[Appropriate tone and complexity]
[Ready to use with minimal editing]\`
  };
}

// Test cases
const prompts = {
  poor: "explain AI",

  okay: "explain AI in simple terms with examples",

  good: \`I need to explain AI to my grandmother who's curious about
how her phone's voice assistant works.

Context: She's 75, not technical, but very curious
Format: 2-3 short paragraphs with a simple analogy
Tone: Patient and warm
Goal: Help her understand without overwhelming her\`
};

console.log("COMPARING PROMPT QUALITIES");
console.log("=".repeat(60) + "\\n");

Object.entries(prompts).forEach(([quality, prompt]) => {
  console.log(\`\${quality.toUpperCase()} PROMPT:\`);
  console.log(\`"\${prompt.substring(0, 50)}..."\`);

  const result = simulateResponse(prompt);

  console.log(\`\\nQuality Score: \${result.quality.toUpperCase()}\`);
  console.log(\`\${result.response}\`);
  console.log("\\n" + "=".repeat(60) + "\\n");
});

console.log("KEY TAKEAWAY:");
console.log("More context + structure + constraints = Better responses!");`}
/>

<Quiz
  title="First Conversation Skills Check"
  questions={[
    {
      question: "You're stuck on a coding problem. What's the BEST way to ask for help?",
      options: [
        "\"Help with my code\"",

        "Just paste the code with no context"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Always provide: (1) your code, (2) what error you're getting, (3) what you expected to happen, (4) what's actually happening, and (5) what you've already tried. This gives the AI all the context needed to help effectively!"
    },
    {
      question: "Why should you specify your skill level when asking questions?",
      options: [
        "To show off how much you know",

        "It's required for the AI to work",
        "To make the prompt longer"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Specifying your skill level helps the AI pitch its response at the right level. 'I'm a complete beginner' gets simple explanations with analogies, while 'I'm experienced but stuck on...' gets more advanced, focused help."

        "Copy the same prompt to multiple AIs"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "If the first response misses the mark, it means your prompt wasn't clear enough! Refine it by adding more context, being more specific about format, or giving an example of what you want. Good prompting is iterative!"
    },
    {
      question: "Which element is LEAST important in a prompt?",

      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Length doesn't matter - clarity does! A focused, clear 50-word prompt beats a rambling 500-word prompt every time. Focus on: context, audience, format, and constraints. Be specific, not lengthy."
