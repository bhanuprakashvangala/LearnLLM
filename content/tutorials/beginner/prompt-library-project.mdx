## Your First Real AI Project!

Congratulations on making it to the hands-on project! Everything you've learned comes together here. You're going to build something incredibly valuable: your own personal prompt library.

<Callout type="tip">
**What You're Building:** A curated collection of 10-15 prompts tailored to YOUR specific needs, organized by category, ready to copy and use whenever you need them. This will save you hours every week!
</Callout>

## Why a Prompt Library?

Think about it: How much time do you spend figuring out how to phrase things to AI? Rewriting prompts when they don't work? Starting from scratch each time?

<Callout type="info">
**Prompt Library:** A curated collection of reusable, tested prompts organized by category and use case. Think of it as your personal cookbook of AI instructions that you can copy, customize, and reuse whenever needed.
</Callout>

**A prompt library solves this:**
- ✅ Copy proven prompts instantly
- ✅ Consistency across your work
- ✅ Learn what works for YOU
- ✅ Share with your team
- ✅ Improve prompts over time

<Callout type="info">
**Real-World Impact:** Professional prompt engineers maintain libraries of 50-200+ prompts. Companies save thousands of hours by sharing prompt libraries across teams. Start your library now and build it over time!
</Callout>

console.log("4. Add your own prompts next!");`}
/>

**Your Task:**
1. Copy all 5 starter prompts to your library
2. Format them using the template from Step 2
3. Test at least 2 of them with real situations

### Step 4: Add 5 Specialized Prompts

Now add prompts specific to YOUR work. Choose from these based on what you do:

#### For Developers:

**Debug Code**
```
I'm getting this error in [LANGUAGE]:

Error message:
[Paste error]

Create 10 headlines for this [CONTENT TYPE]:

**Topic:** [What it's about]
**Angle:** [Main hook or unique perspective]
**Audience:** [Who]
**Goal:** [Click / share / read]

Use these formulas (mix them):
- Number lists (e.g., "7 Ways to...")
- How-to (e.g., "How to X Without Y")

Tone: [Playful / Serious / Professional / Provocative]
```

#### For Students/Learners:

**Study Plan Creator**
```
I need to learn [TOPIC/SKILL] in [TIMEFRAME].

**Current level:** [What you know now]

Make it realistic for someone with [time constraints or other commitments]
```

**Note-Taking Enhancement**
```
I took these notes from [SOURCE]:

[Paste your raw notes]

Improve them for study/review:

1. **Summary** (3-5 sentences of key points)

2. **Organized Notes**
   - Main concepts
   - Supporting details
   - Important examples

3. **Key Terms** (Define in simple language)

4. **Self-Test Questions** (5 questions to check understanding)

5. **Connections** (How does this relate to [other topic/concept]?)

Format: Clean, scannable, perfect for review before exam
```

#### For Managers/Professionals:

**Meeting Agenda Creator**
```
Create an agenda for a [MEETING TYPE] about [TOPIC]

**Attendees:** [Who - roles]
**Duration:** [Time limit]
**Goal:** [What must be decided/achieved]

Include:
1. Pre-meeting prep (what attendees should review/bring)
2. Agenda items with time allocations
3. Decision-making method (vote, consensus, leader decides)
4. Success criteria (how we know meeting was productive)

Constraints:
- Keep it [tight and efficient / collaborative and thorough]
- Must address [specific issue]
- Avoid [common meeting pitfall]
```

**Performance Feedback**
```
Help me write performance feedback for [ROLE] on my team.

**Context:**
- Time period: [Duration]
- Overall performance: [Exceeds / Meets / Below expectations]
- Key projects: [What they worked on]

**Strengths (specific examples):**
- [Example 1]
- [Example 2]

**Areas for improvement:**
- [Area 1]: [Specific behavior/outcome]
- [Area 2]: [Specific behavior/outcome]

**Goals for next period:**
- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]

Write feedback that is:
- Specific (with examples)
- Balanced (recognize strengths, address gaps)
- Actionable (clear next steps)
- [Encouraging / Direct but kind / Firm]
- 200-300 words

Remember: This person is [context about them - tenure, experience, etc.]
```

**Your Task:** Choose 5 prompts that match YOUR work and add them to your library.

### Step 5: Document and Organize

Now organize your 10 prompts (5 starter + 5 specialized):

**Recommended Structure:**

```
📚 MY PROMPT LIBRARY
├── 📁 Learning & Research
│   ├── Explain Any Concept Simply
│   └── Study Plan Creator
├── 📁 Content Creation
│   ├── Content Outline Generator
│   ├── Headline Generator
│   └── Content Repurposing
├── 📁 Communication
│   ├── Professional Email Writer
│   └── Performance Feedback
├── 📁 Decision Making
│   └── Decision Analysis Framework
├── 📁 Analysis & Feedback
│   └── Get Constructive Feedback
└── 📁 Coding (if applicable)
    ├── Debug Code
    └── Code Review
```

**Your Task:**
1. Create folders/sections for your categories
2. Move your 10 prompts into the right categories
3. Add a "Quick Reference" section at the top with your most-used prompts

### Step 6: Test and Refine

**Testing Checklist:**

For each prompt:
- [ ] Used it with a real situation (not hypothetical)
- [ ] Documented what worked
- [ ] Noted what to improve
- [ ] Created at least one variation
- [ ] Estimated time saved

**Refinement Process:**

1. **Try the prompt as-is**
2. **Note the result quality (1-10)**
3. **If under 7, identify what's missing:**
   - More context needed?
   - Better examples?
   - Clearer constraints?
   - Different structure?
4. **Adjust and re-test**
5. **Update your library with the improved version**

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro Tip:** Add a "Version History" section to your best prompts. When you improve a prompt, keep the old version with a note about what changed and why. This helps you learn what makes prompts better!
</Callout>

## Bonus: Advanced Library Features

### Feature 1: Prompt Chains

Some tasks need multiple prompts in sequence. Document these as "workflows":

<Callout type="info">
**Prompt Chain:** A sequence of prompts where each step builds on the previous one's output. Like an assembly line, you break complex tasks into smaller steps, feeding each result into the next prompt for better overall quality.
</Callout>

**Example: Blog Post Creation Workflow**

```
WORKFLOW: Complete Blog Post (30 min total)

Step 1: Outline (5 min)
→ Use: "Content Outline Generator" prompt
→ Input: Topic and audience
→ Output: Detailed outline

Step 2: Write Introduction (7 min)
→ Use: "Write Engaging Intro" prompt
→ Input: Outline + Topic
→ Output: Hook, problem, preview

Step 3: Write Main Content (15 min)
→ For each section in outline:
   Use: "Expand Section" prompt
→ Output: Full paragraphs

Step 4: Conclusion (3 min)
→ Use: "Write Conclusion" prompt
→ Input: Main points covered
→ Output: Summary + CTA
```

### Feature 2: Prompt Variables

Create "fill-in-the-blank" prompts with clear placeholders:

```
PLACEHOLDERS GUIDE

When you see:
[BRACKETS] = Replace with your specific info
{BRACES} = Optional - include only if relevant
<ANGLE BRACKETS> = Choose one option

Example:
Write a {friendly / formal} email to [RECIPIENT] about <requesting extension / declining offer / following up> on [SPECIFIC THING].
```

### Feature 3: Quality Checklist

Add this to high-stakes prompts:

```
BEFORE SUBMITTING THIS PROMPT:

✓ Did I include specific context?
✓ Is my audience clearly defined?
✓ Are constraints specified (length, tone, format)?
✓ Did I give examples if the style matters?
✓ Am I being specific, not vague?
✓ Did I mention what to avoid?
✓ Is my goal clear?

If any ✗ → Improve prompt before sending!
```

### Customization Points

- **[PERSONALIZATION HOOK]**: Research them on LinkedIn, recent company news, blog posts. Be specific!
- **[RELEVANT PROOF]**: Choose what resonates with THEM (not just your biggest win)
- **[THE ASK]**: Match their seniority (CEO = bigger ask OK, IC = smaller ask)

### Example Usage

**Context:** Reaching out to VP of Marketing at mid-size SaaS company

**Hook Used:** "Saw your post about struggling with SEO content ROI"

**Result:**
- Subject: "Quick question about your SEO content strategy"
- Body: 85 words, referenced their specific pain point
- Response Rate: Got reply in 2 days asking for call

**Output Quality:** 9/10 - Felt personalized, clear value prop

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Research First:** Spend 5 min researching them - their content, company news, recent wins
2. **One Hook per Email:** Don't try to personalize multiple ways - pick the strongest one
3. **Test Subjects:** If no response in 1 week, your subject likely failed - improve it
4. **Follow-up Prompt:** Use "Write Follow-up Email" if no response in 4 days

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Making it about you instead of them
❌ Being too long (over 100 words)
❌ Generic subject lines ("Quick question" alone)
❌ Asking for too much too soon

### Variations

**For LinkedIn Messages (modify prompt):**
Replace "Email" with "LinkedIn message"
Change length to "50-60 words (LinkedIn is shorter!)"
Subject line → Not needed

**For Warm Introductions:**
Add: "Mutual connection: [NAME] suggested I reach out"
Soften tone slightly (less formal)

### Version History

- v2.0 (2024-01): Added personalization hook requirement - improved response 15%
- v1.0 (2023-11): Original version - generic, ~25% response rate

**Your Task:** Pick your best prompt and document it to this level of detail.

## Test Your Library Building

<Quiz
  title="Prompt Library Project Check"
  questions={[
    {
      question: "What's the MOST important thing when choosing prompts for your library?",
      options: [
        "Pick the most complicated prompts to look impressive",
        "Choose prompts YOU actually use frequently in YOUR work",
        "Copy exactly what others use",
        "Include every possible category"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Your library should solve YOUR problems! If you never write sales emails, don't include email prompts just because they're 'important.' Focus on what you do daily/weekly. A library of 10 prompts you actually use beats 100 prompts you never touch."
    },
    {
      question: "How should you test prompts before adding them to your library?",
      options: [
        "Just add them - testing wastes time",
        "Use them with real situations, note quality, refine if needed",
        "Test with hypothetical examples",
        "Ask the AI if the prompt is good"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Always test with REAL situations! Hypothetical tests don't reveal real problems. Use each prompt for actual work, rate the output quality (1-10), note what worked and what didn't, then refine. Only add to your library after testing and improving."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the main benefit of documenting 'customization points' for each prompt?",
      options: [
        "Makes the documentation longer",
        "Helps you remember what to change each time you use it",
        "It's required for prompts to work",
        "Makes you look professional"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Customization points are YOUR future-self's best friend! When you use a prompt 3 months later, you'll forget what to change. Clear notes like '[AUDIENCE] - Replace with who you're writing for' save time and prevent mistakes. You copy, customize, and go!"
    },
    {
      question: "How often should you update your prompt library?",
      options: [
        "Never - once created, it's done",
        "Every day without fail",
        "When you discover better versions or find prompts don't work well",
        "Only when starting a new job"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Your library is living, not static! Update when: (1) you improve a prompt and get better results, (2) a prompt stops working well, (3) you discover new patterns, (4) your work changes. Good practice: Review quarterly and update your top 5 most-used prompts."
    },
    {
      question: "What's a 'prompt chain' and when should you use one?",
      options: [
        "Using multiple prompts in sequence for complex tasks",
        "Linking prompts together randomly",
        "A prompt that's very long",
        "A backup prompt if the first fails"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "Prompt chains break complex work into steps! Example: Blog post = (1) Generate outline → (2) Write intro → (3) Expand each section → (4) Write conclusion. Each step is a separate prompt using output from the previous. Document your best workflows this way!"
