## The Power of "Show, Don't Tell"

You've probably heard the writing advice: "Show, don't tell." The same principle applies to prompting AI! Instead of describing what you want, you can SHOW the AI examples, and it will learn the pattern.

This is called **Few-Shot Learning**—teaching the AI by giving it a few examples.

<Callout type="info">
**Real-World Example:** Instead of saying "write in a casual, friendly tone," you could show two examples of casual, friendly writing. The AI will match that exact style much better than following a description!
</Callout>

## What is Few-Shot Learning?

Few-shot learning is a prompting technique where you provide examples of input-output pairs to demonstrate the pattern you want.

<Callout type="info">
**Few-Shot Learning Definition:** A prompting technique where you teach the AI by showing it a few examples (usually 2-5) of what you want, rather than just describing it. The AI learns the pattern from your examples and applies it to new inputs, resulting in more consistent and accurate outputs.
</Callout>

**The Three Types:**

  rows={[
    {
      feature: "Zero-Shot",

    },
    {
      feature: "One-Shot",

    },
    {
      feature: "Many-Shot",
      values: ["6+ examples", "Complex pattern or very specific requirements"],
      description: "Show extensive examples"
    }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="info">
**Zero-Shot Learning Definition:** Asking the AI to perform a task without providing any examples, relying only on its training and your description. For example, "Summarize this article" with no example summaries. Zero-shot works well for common tasks the AI already understands.
</Callout>

## Why Few-Shot Works So Well

AI models are trained on patterns. When you give examples, you're showing the AI exactly what pattern to follow. It's like:

- **Zero-shot:** "Cook me dinner" (vague)
- **Few-shot:** "Cook me dinner. Yesterday you made pasta with tomato sauce. Tuesday you made stir-fried vegetables with rice." (now the AI knows your style!)

Let's see this in action:

<CodePlayground
  language="javascript"
  runnable={true}
  title="Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Comparison"
  initialCode={`// Simulating how examples improve AI responses

function simulateResponse(prompt, examples = []) {
  const shotType = examples.length === 0 ? "ZERO-SHOT" :
                   examples.length === 1 ? "ONE-SHOT" :
                   examples.length <= 5 ? "FEW-SHOT" : "MANY-SHOT";

  console.log(\`\n${"=".repeat(60)}\`);
  console.log(\`\${shotType} PROMPTING\`);
  console.log(\`${"=".repeat(60)}\n\`);

  console.log("PROMPT:", prompt);

  if (examples.length > 0) {
    console.log(\`\nEXAMPLES PROVIDED (\${examples.length}):\`);
    examples.forEach((ex, i) => {
      console.log(\`  Example \${i + 1}:\`);
      console.log(\`    Input: "\${ex.input}"\`);
      console.log(\`    Output: "\${ex.output}"\`);
    });
  }

  // Simulate quality improvement
  const quality = examples.length === 0 ? "Generic" :
                  examples.length === 1 ? "Better" :
                  examples.length <= 5 ? "Great" : "Excellent";

  console.log(\`\nRESPONSE QUALITY: \${quality}\`);
  console.log(\`PATTERN MATCHING: \${examples.length > 0 ? "✓ Clear" : "✗ Unclear"}\`);

  return { shotType, quality, exampleCount: examples.length };
}

// Scenario: Converting product features to customer benefits

console.log("TASK: Convert product features into customer benefits\n");

// Zero-shot attempt
simulateResponse(
  "Convert this feature to a customer benefit: '256GB storage'",
  []
);

// One-shot
simulateResponse(
  "Convert this feature to a customer benefit: '256GB storage'",
  [
    {
      input: "Waterproof to 50 meters",
      output: "Take underwater photos without worry"
    }
  ]
);

// Few-shot
simulateResponse(
  "Convert this feature to a customer benefit: '256GB storage'",
  [
    {
      input: "Waterproof to 50 meters",

      output: "Use all day without charging"
    },
    {
      input: "4K video recording",
      output: "Capture memories in stunning detail"
    }
  ]
);

console.log(\`\n${"=".repeat(60)}\`);
console.log("OBSERVATION: More examples = More consistent pattern matching!");
console.log("The AI learns your exact style and format from examples.");`}
/>

## How to Write Effective Examples

Not all examples are created equal! Here's how to write examples that work:

### Rule 1: Examples Should Be Similar to Your Target

**❌ Bad Examples (Not Similar):**
```
Convert this product feature to a customer benefit:

Example 1:
Feature: "Bluetooth 5.0"
Benefit: "Connect to devices"

Example 2:
Feature: "7-day battery life"
Benefit: "Never worry about charging during your week"

Example 3:
Feature: "50MP camera"
Benefit: "Pictures look good"

Now convert: "IP68 water resistance"
```

**Problems:**
- Example 1 is too vague
- Example 2 is perfect (good!)
- Example 3 is too simple
- Inconsistent quality confuses the AI

**✅ Good Examples (Consistent Quality):**
```
Convert this product feature to a customer benefit:

Example 1:
Feature: "7-day battery life"
Benefit: "Go an entire week without charging—perfect for busy professionals"

Example 2:
Feature: "50MP camera"
Benefit: "Capture every detail—print poster-sized photos without blur"

Example 3:
Feature: "5G connectivity"
Benefit: "Download movies in seconds—never wait for content again"

Now convert: "IP68 water resistance"
```

**Why it works:** Consistent format, consistent quality, consistent level of detail

### Rule 2: Use 2-5 Examples (Sweet Spot)

<ComparisonTable
  title="Example Count Guide"
  columns={[
    { title: "Best For" },
    { title: "Pros/Cons" }
  ]}
  rows={[
    {
      feature: "1 Example",
      values: ["Simple patterns", "Pro: Concise, Con: Might not capture full pattern"]
    },
    {
      feature: "2-3 Examples",
      values: ["Most tasks", "Pro: Establishes pattern clearly, Con: None"],
      description: "Recommended default"
    },
    {
      feature: "4-5 Examples",
      values: ["Complex patterns or specific style", "Pro: Very clear pattern, Con: Uses more tokens"]
    },
    {
      feature: "6+ Examples",
      values: ["Highly specific formats", "Pro: Maximum clarity, Con: Expensive (many tokens)"]
    }
  ]}
/>

### Rule 3: Cover Edge Cases

If your task has variations, show examples of each:

**Example: Sentiment Analysis**
```
Classify the sentiment of customer reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral:

Example 1 (clearly positive):
Review: "This product changed my life! Best purchase ever."
Sentiment: Positive

Example 2 (clearly negative):
Review: "Broke after two days. Complete waste of money."
Sentiment: Negative

Example 3 (mixed/neutral):
Review: "It works fine, but nothing special. Average product."
Sentiment: Neutral

Example 4 (subtle negative):
Review: "I guess it's okay if you don't have high expectations."
Sentiment: Negative

Now classify: "Fast shipping, but the product itself is disappointing."
```

Why this works: Covers obvious cases AND edge cases (mixed reviews, subtle negativity)

## Practical Examples by Use Case

### Use Case 1: Data Formatting

**Task:** Convert addresses to a specific format

<CodePlayground
  language="javascript"
  runnable={true}
  title="Few-Shot Data Formatting"
  initialCode={`// Few-shot learning for data formatting

function demonstrateFewShot() {
  const prompt = \`
Convert these addresses to the format: [Street] | [City], [State] [ZIP]

Examples:
Input: "123 Main Street, Springfield, IL 62701"
Output: "123 Main Street | Springfield, IL 62701"

Input: "456 Oak Ave, Austin, Texas 78701"
Output: "456 Oak Ave | Austin, TX 78701"

Input: "789 Pine Road, New York, NY 10001"
Output: "789 Pine Road | New York, NY 10001"

Now convert: "321 Elm Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90001"
\`;

  console.log("FEW-SHOT PROMPT:");
  console.log("=".repeat(60));
  console.log(prompt);
  console.log("=".repeat(60));

  // Simulated AI response (in reality, would use actual AI)
  const expectedOutput = "321 Elm Boulevard | Los Angeles, CA 90001";

  console.log("\nEXPECTED OUTPUT:");
  console.log(expectedOutput);

  console.log("\n✓ The AI learned:");
  console.log("  1. Use pipe (|) as separator");
  console.log("  2. Keep street address as-is");
  console.log("  3. Abbreviate state names (California → CA)");
  console.log("  4. Format: [Street] | [City], [State] [ZIP]");

  console.log("\nWITHOUT FEW-SHOT:");
  console.log("The AI might format it differently each time!");
}

demonstrateFewShot();

console.log("\n" + "=".repeat(60));
console.log("KEY INSIGHT: Examples create consistency!");`}
/>

### Use Case 2: Tone Matching

**Scenario:** You need the AI to match a specific writing style

**❌ Without Examples:**
```
Write a product description for noise-canceling headphones.
Make it casual and friendly.
```

**✅ With Examples:**
```
Write a product description in the same style as these examples:

Example 1 (Coffee maker):
"Your mornings just got 10x better. This little beauty brews
barista-quality coffee while you're still half-asleep. One button.
Perfect coffee. Every time."

Example 2 (Fitness tracker):
"Meet your new workout buddy. Tracks your steps, cheers you on,
and never judges you for that midnight snack. (We've all been there.)"

Example 3 (Bluetooth speaker):
"Tiny but mighty. This speaker punches way above its weight class.
Pool party? Check. Road trip? Check. Shower concert? Oh yeah."

Now write for: Noise-canceling headphones
```

The AI will match:
- Short, punchy sentences
- Casual, conversational tone
- Direct address ("you," "your")
- Personality and humor
- Benefit-focused, not feature-focused

### Use Case 3: Code Generation with Specific Style

<CodePlayground
  language="javascript"
  runnable={true}
  title="Few-Shot Code Style Learning"
  initialCode={`// Teaching AI your code style through examples

const fewShotCodePrompt = \`
Write JavaScript functions following this style:

Example 1:
Task: Check if number is even
Code:
/**
 * Checks if a number is even
 * @param {number} num - Number to check
 * @returns {boolean} True if even
 */
const isEven = (num) => num % 2 === 0;

Example 2:
Task: Get array maximum
Code:
/**
 * Finds maximum value in array
 * @param {number[]} arr - Array of numbers
 * @returns {number} Maximum value
 */
const getMax = (arr) => Math.max(...arr);

Example 3:
Task: Capitalize first letter
Code:
/**
 * Capitalizes first letter of string
 * @param {string} str - String to capitalize
 * @returns {string} Capitalized string
 */
const capitalize = (str) =>
  str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1).toLowerCase();

Now write: Function to sum all numbers in an array
\`;

console.log("FEW-SHOT CODE STYLE PROMPT:");
console.log("=".repeat(60));
console.log(fewShotCodePrompt);
console.log("\n=".repeat(60));

console.log("\nWHAT THE AI LEARNS:");
console.log("✓ Use JSDoc comments");
console.log("✓ Arrow function syntax");
console.log("✓ Concise, one-line implementations when possible");
console.log("✓ Descriptive parameter names");
console.log("✓ Consistent naming (camelCase)");

console.log("\nEXPECTED OUTPUT:");
const exampleOutput = \`
/**
 * Sums all numbers in an array
 * @param {number[]} arr - Array of numbers to sum
 * @returns {number} Sum of all numbers
 */
const sumArray = (arr) => arr.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
\`;
console.log(exampleOutput);`}
/>

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Mistake 1: Too Many Examples

**Problem:**
```
[Provides 15 examples for a simple task]
```

**Why it's bad:**
- Wastes tokens (= higher cost)
- Slower responses
- Diminishing returns after 5-6 examples

**Fix:** Start with 2-3 examples. Only add more if needed.

### Mistake 2: Inconsistent Examples

**Problem:**
```
Example 1: Very detailed, 3 paragraphs
Example 2: One sentence
Example 3: Medium detail
```

**Why it's bad:** AI doesn't know which style to match

**Fix:** Make all examples similar in length, detail, and quality

### Mistake 3: Examples That Don't Match the Task

**Problem:**
```
Teaching AI to write emails, but examples are social media posts
```

**Why it's bad:** Different formats, different audiences, different conventions

**Fix:** Examples should be from the same domain as your task

<Callout type="warning">
**Token Warning:** Each example uses tokens from your context window! If you have a 4,000-token limit and use 1,500 tokens on examples, you only have 2,500 left for your prompt and the AI's response. Balance thoroughness with efficiency.
</Callout>

## Advanced Few-Shot Patterns

### Pattern 1: Progressive Difficulty

Show examples from simple to complex:

```
Extract the main topic from these sentences:

Example 1 (simple):
Sentence: "I love pizza."
Topic: Food

Example 2 (medium):
Sentence: "The new restaurant downtown serves amazing Italian food."
Topic: Food/Dining

Example 3 (complex):
Sentence: "After trying the new Italian place, I'm convinced that authentic
pizza requires a wood-fired oven and imported ingredients."
Topic: Food/Cooking/Quality

Now extract from: "Climate change affects global food supply chains."
```

### Pattern 2: Chain of Thought in Examples

Show your reasoning:

<Callout type="info">
**Chain of Thought Definition:** A technique where you show the AI your step-by-step reasoning process in examples, not just the final answer. This helps the AI understand how to think through problems logically and produce more accurate, explainable results for complex tasks.
</Callout>

```
Solve these word problems:

Example:
Problem: "Sarah has 5 apples. She gives 2 to John. How many does she have?"
Reasoning: Start with 5, subtract 2 that were given away
Answer: 3 apples

Example:
Problem: "A book costs $12. You buy 3 books. What's the total?"
Reasoning: Multiply unit price ($12) by quantity (3)
Answer: $36

Now solve: "Tom runs 3 miles per day. How far in a week?"
```

### Pattern 3: Error Correction

Show what's wrong and what's right:

```
Fix grammatical errors in these sentences:

Example:
Wrong: "Me and him went to the store."
Right: "He and I went to the store."
Reason: Use "I" not "me" as subject

Example:
Wrong: "The data shows a trend."
Right: "The data show a trend."
Reason: "Data" is plural (datum is singular)

Now fix: "Between you and I, this seems wrong."
```

    {
      question: "What is the main benefit of few-shot learning over zero-shot?",

        "It's required for AI to work",
        "It uses less tokens"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Few-shot learning's power is in showing, not telling. Instead of describing 'write in a casual tone,' you show 2-3 examples of casual writing. The AI matches the pattern much more accurately than following a description."
    },

      options: [
        "Always use exactly 1",

        "At least 10 examples",
        "As many as possible"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "2-5 examples is the sweet spot! 1 example might not establish the pattern clearly. 2-3 usually works great. 4-5 for complex patterns. More than 6 has diminishing returns and wastes tokens. Start with 2-3 and add more only if needed."
    },

        "The AI ignores the brief one",
        "Nothing—inconsistency doesn't matter"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Inconsistent examples confuse the AI! If Example 1 is a detailed 3-paragraph response and Example 2 is one sentence, the AI doesn't know which to match. Keep examples consistent in length, detail level, and quality so the pattern is clear."
    },
    {
      question: "When should you use zero-shot instead of few-shot?",
      options: [
        "Never—always use examples",

        "Only when you're lazy",
        "When you want worse results"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Zero-shot is perfect for common, straightforward tasks where the AI already knows what to do and you don't need a specific format. Example: 'Summarize this article' or 'Translate to Spanish.' Save tokens, use few-shot only when you need to demonstrate a specific pattern or style."
    },

      question: "What's a key consideration when using many examples (6+)?",

      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Token economics matter! Each example uses tokens. 10 examples might use 500-1000 tokens, leaving less room for your actual prompt and the AI's response. Plus, more tokens = higher cost. Use 2-5 examples for most tasks; only go higher for very complex patterns."

## Key Takeaways

🎯 **Show, Don't Tell**
- Examples are more powerful than descriptions
- 2-3 good examples > long explanations
- AI learns patterns from examples naturally

🎯 **Quality Over Quantity**
- 2-5 examples is usually optimal
- Keep examples consistent in quality and format
- Cover edge cases if your task has variations

🎯 **When to Use Few-Shot**
- Specific format or style needed
- Data transformation tasks
- Tone/voice matching
- Classification with multiple categories

🎯 **Watch Your Tokens**
- Each example uses tokens
- Balance thoroughness with efficiency
- Start with fewer examples, add more if needed

## Practice Challenges

**Challenge 1: Tone Matching**
Find 3 pieces of writing you like (emails, blog posts, etc.). Create a few-shot prompt that teaches the AI to match that exact tone. Test it!

**Challenge 2: Data Formatting**
You have messy data (addresses, dates, names). Create a few-shot prompt that reformats it consistently. Start with 2 examples, test, then add a 3rd if needed.

**Challenge 3: Creative Writing**
Write 2-3 examples of very short stories (2-3 sentences each) in a specific style. Then have the AI write another in the same style.

<Callout type="tip">
**Next Level:** Start a "Few-Shot Library" where you save your best example sets. When you create a great few-shot prompt for email writing, save it! Reuse successful patterns for similar future tasks.
