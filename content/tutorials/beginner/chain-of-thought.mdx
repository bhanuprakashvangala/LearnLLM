## Remember "Show Your Work"?

In school, math teachers always said: "Show your work!" They wanted to see your reasoning, not just the answer. It turns out, AI works the same way—when it "shows its work," it gets better answers!

This technique is called **Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting**, and it's one of the most powerful advances in prompt engineering.

<Callout type="info">
**Mind-Blowing Discovery:** Research found that simply adding "Let's think step by step" to prompts dramatically improved AI performance on complex reasoning tasks. Sometimes by 50%+ accuracy! This simple phrase makes the AI break down problems instead of jumping to conclusions.
</Callout>

## What is Chain of Thought Prompting?

**Chain of Thought (CoT)** is a prompting technique where you ask the AI to explain its reasoning process step-by-step before giving the final answer.

<Callout type="info">
**Chain of Thought (CoT):** A prompting technique that instructs AI to break down complex problems into intermediate reasoning steps before providing the final answer. This dramatically improves accuracy on tasks requiring logic, math, or multi-step reasoning.
</Callout>

### Without CoT (Direct Answer)

**Prompt:** "If a store has 15 apples and sells 60% of them, how many are left?"

**AI Response:** "6 apples are left."

**Problem:** We don't know if the AI calculated correctly!

### With CoT (Step-by-Step Reasoning)

**Prompt:** "If a store has 15 apples and sells 60% of them, how many are left? Let's think step by step."

**AI Response:**
```
Let's break this down:
1. Start with 15 apples total
2. Calculate 60% of 15: 15 × 0.60 = 9 apples sold
3. Subtract sold from total: 15 - 9 = 6 apples remaining

Answer: 6 apples are left.
```

**Benefit:** We can see the reasoning! If there's an error, we know where.

## When to Use Chain of Thought

CoT isn't needed for everything. Here's when it shines:

### ✅ Use CoT For:

1. **Math Problems**
   - Word problems
   - Calculations
   - Percentages, ratios

2. **Logical Reasoning**
   - "If... then..." scenarios
   - Cause and effect
   - Deduction puzzles

3. **Multi-Step Problems**
   - Anything requiring 2+ steps
   - Planning tasks
   - Troubleshooting

4. **Complex Analysis**
   - Comparing options
   - Decision-making
   - Strategy planning

### ❌ Don't Need CoT For:

1. **Simple Facts**
   - "What's the capital of France?" → "Paris" (no reasoning needed)

2. **Direct Lookups**
   - "Define photosynthesis"
   - "Who wrote Hamlet?"

3. **Creative Writing**
   - Stories, poems (unless you want to see the creative process!)

4. **Simple Formatting**
   - "Convert this to uppercase"

<Callout type="tip">
**Rule of Thumb:** If a 5-year-old could answer instantly, you don't need CoT. If YOU would need to think through steps, use CoT!
</Callout>

## Types of Chain of Thought

### 1. Zero-Shot CoT (Just Add the Magic Phrase)

**The simplest form—just add "Let's think step by step"**

<Callout type="info">
**Zero-Shot:** A technique where the AI performs a task without any examples provided in the prompt. Adding "Let's think step by step" to any question triggers reasoning without needing example demonstrations.
</Callout>

```
Problem: A shirt costs $40 and is on sale for 25% off. What's the sale price?

Let's think step by step.
```

**AI Response:**
```
1. Original price: $40
2. Discount amount: 25% of $40 = $40 × 0.25 = $10
3. Sale price: $40 - $10 = $30

Answer: $30
```

### 2. Few-Shot CoT (Show Examples with Reasoning)

**Provide examples that include step-by-step reasoning:**

```
Solve these word problems:

Example:
Problem: "Sarah has 12 cookies. She gives 1/3 to her friend. How many does she keep?"
Reasoning:
- Start: 12 cookies
- Give away: 1/3 of 12 = 12 ÷ 3 = 4 cookies
- Keep: 12 - 4 = 8 cookies
Answer: 8 cookies

Example:
Problem: "A car travels 60 mph for 2.5 hours. How far did it go?"
Reasoning:
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 60 × 2.5 = 150 miles
Answer: 150 miles

Now solve:
Problem: "A recipe needs 3 eggs for 12 cookies. How many eggs for 30 cookies?"
```

### 3. Structured CoT (Guide the Steps)

**Tell the AI exactly what steps to follow:**

```
Analyze this business decision using these steps:

1. State the problem clearly
2. List all relevant factors
3. Identify pros and cons
4. Consider risks
5. Make a recommendation with reasoning

Decision: Should we expand to a new city now or wait 6 months?

Context: [provide business context]

## Real-World Applications

### Application 1: Debugging Code Logic

**Without CoT:**
```
Why doesn't this code work?

function calculateTotal(prices) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let price of prices) {
    total + price;
  }
  return total;
}
```

**With CoT:**
```
Debug this code by thinking through each step:

function calculateTotal(prices) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let price of prices) {
    total + price;
  }
  return total;
}

Walk through what happens:
1. What's the function supposed to do?
2. What does each line do?
3. What's the error?
4. How to fix it?
```

**AI Response with CoT:**
```
Let's debug step by step:

1. Purpose: Function should sum all prices in the array

2. Line-by-line execution:
   - Line 1: Initialize total to 0 ✓
   - Line 2: Loop through each price ✓
   - Line 3: ❌ PROBLEM HERE
   - Line 4: Return total ✓

3. The Error:
   Line 3 says "total + price" but doesn't assign the result!
   This just calculates the sum and throws it away.
   It should be "total += price" or "total = total + price"

4. Fixed Code:
   function calculateTotal(prices) {
     let total = 0;
     for (let price of prices) {
       total += price;  // Changed this line
     }
     return total;
   }

The bug: Missing assignment operator (+=)
```

### Application 2: Complex Decision Making

<CodePlayground
  language="javascript"
  runnable={true}
  title="CoT for Decision Making"
  initialCode={`// Chain of Thought for structured decision-making

function structuredDecisionPrompt(decision, context, factors) {
  const prompt = \`
Decision to make: \${decision}

Context:
\${context}

Relevant factors:
\${factors.join('\\n')}

Analyze this decision using Chain of Thought:

Step 1: Clarify the decision
- What exactly are we deciding?
- What's the timeline?

Step 2: List options
- What are all possible choices?

Step 3: Evaluate each option
- Pros and cons of each
- Short-term vs long-term impact

Step 4: Consider risks
- What could go wrong with each option?
- How likely and severe?

Step 5: Make recommendation
- Which option is best and why?
- What should be done first?
\`;

  return prompt;
}

// Example usage
const decision = "Should our startup hire a full-time designer or use freelancers?";

const context = \`
- Series A startup, 15 employees
- Currently using freelancers ($5k/month)
- Full-time would cost $90k/year + benefits
- Growing fast, lots of design work needed
- 6 months of runway left
\`;

const factors = [
  "- Cost: Full-time $120k/year vs Freelance $60k/year",
  "- Quality: Need consistent brand",
  "- Flexibility: Work volume fluctuates",
  "- Speed: Tight deadlines on product launches",
  "- Company culture: Want to build design-focused culture"
];

const prompt = structuredDecisionPrompt(decision, context, factors);

console.log("=".repeat(70));
console.log(prompt);
console.log("=".repeat(70));

console.log("\nEXAMPLE AI RESPONSE (with CoT):\n");
console.log("Step 1: Clarify the decision");
console.log("- Decision: Hiring model for design work");
console.log("- Timeline: Need to decide now (affects next quarter planning)");

console.log("Step 2: Options");
console.log("A) Hire full-time designer ($120k/year total)");
console.log("B) Continue with freelancers ($60k/year)");
console.log("C) Hybrid: Part-time designer + freelancers");
console.log();

console.log("Step 3: Evaluation");
console.log("Option A (Full-time):");
console.log("  Pros: Consistent quality, faster, builds culture, always available");
console.log("  Cons: 2x cost, commitment, uses precious runway");
console.log();
console.log("Option B (Freelancers):");
console.log("  Pros: Lower cost, flexible, no commitment");
console.log("  Cons: Inconsistent, slower, scheduling issues");
console.log();
console.log("Option C (Hybrid):");
console.log("  Pros: Balance of consistency and flexibility");
console.log("  Cons: Management overhead, still significant cost");
console.log();

console.log("Step 4: Risks");
console.log("Option A risk: If growth slows, expensive commitment");
console.log("Option B risk: Quality issues hurt product, brand inconsistency");
console.log("Option C risk: Coordination complexity");
console.log();

console.log("Step 5: Recommendation");
console.log("Choose Option C (Hybrid) because:");
console.log("1. Runway concern (6 months) makes full $120k risky");
console.log("2. Growth needs require more than pure freelance");
console.log("3. Part-time ($60k) + freelance ($30k) = $90k (between options)");
console.log("4. Can convert to full-time if/when Series B closes");

/>

### Application 3: Teaching and Learning

**Prompt:**
```
I'm learning React and don't understand why we need useState. I know how to use it, but not WHY it exists.

Explain using Chain of Thought:
1. What problem existed before useState?
2. How does useState solve it?
3. Why can't we just use regular variables?
Use simple language and examples.
```

This gets a much better educational response than "Explain useState"!

## Advanced CoT Techniques

### Technique 1: Self-Consistency

Ask the AI to solve the same problem multiple ways, then compare:

```
Solve this problem using THREE different approaches, then compare:

Problem: A store offers 20% off an item, then adds 8% sales tax. Is this the same as adding 8% tax then taking 20% off? Use a $100 item as example.

Approach 1: Discount first
Approach 2: Tax first
Approach 3: Mathematical proof

Then: Compare the final prices and explain if order matters.
```

### Technique 2: Tree of Thought

For very complex problems, explore multiple reasoning paths:

```
Complex problem: [problem]

Explore 3 different strategies:

Strategy 1: [approach name]
- Step 1: ...
- Step 2: ...
- Conclusion: ...

Strategy 2: [approach name]
- Step 1: ...
- Step 2: ...
- Conclusion: ...

Strategy 3: [approach name]
- Step 1: ...
- Step 2: ...
- Conclusion: ...

Final: Compare strategies and recommend the best one.
```

### Technique 3: Verification Steps

Add a verification step to catch errors:

```
Solve this problem step by step, then verify your answer:

Problem: [complex problem]

Solution:
[Step-by-step reasoning]

Verification:
1. Check if the answer makes logical sense
2. Try working backwards from the answer
3. Check calculations
4. Final confidence level (Low/Medium/High)
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** Chain of Thought uses more tokens! A response might go from 50 tokens (direct answer) to 200 tokens (with reasoning). This means:
- Higher cost (if paying per token)
- Uses more of your context window
- Slightly slower responses

Use CoT when accuracy matters more than speed/cost!
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Tokens:** The basic units that AI models use to process text. Roughly, one token equals about 4 characters or 0.75 words. Both your input and AI's output consume tokens, which determines API costs and context limits.
</Callout>

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using CoT for Simple Tasks

**❌ Overkill:**
```
What color is the sky? Let's think step by step.
```

**✅ Better:**
```
What color is the sky?
```

### Mistake 2: Not Being Specific About Steps

**❌ Vague:**
```
Solve this problem step by step.
```

**✅ Better:**
```
Solve this problem by:
1. Identifying known variables
2. Determining what to find
3. Showing calculations
4. Stating the answer with units
```

### Mistake 3: Ignoring the Reasoning Output

**Problem:** You asked for step-by-step reasoning, got it, but just look at the final answer.

**Fix:** Actually READ the reasoning! That's where you learn and catch errors.

## Practice Challenges

**Challenge 1: Math Problem**
Take a word problem (create one or find one online). Try it:
1. Without CoT
2. With "Let's think step by step"
3. Compare the reasoning quality

**Challenge 2: Decision Making**
Think of a real decision you're facing. Create a structured CoT prompt that breaks it down into:
- Problem clarification
- Options
- Pros/cons
- Risks
- Recommendation

**Challenge 3: Learning**
Pick a concept you're learning. Ask the AI to explain it with CoT:
1. What the concept is
2. Why it exists (what problem it solves)
3. How it works
4. When to use it

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro Tip:** Combine CoT with few-shot learning! Show examples that include step-by-step reasoning. This is incredibly powerful for teaching AI your exact thinking process.
